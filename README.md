# Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:-
● Prepare the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output
parameters) relevant to the problem you will solve.
● Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different
algorithms, settings and see which model is best for your scenario.
Task 3:- Create a machine learning model to predict the insurance price charged to the
customer. The charge depends on various features such as age, type of coverage,
amount of coverage needed, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, and other special
factors like smoking to determine what health risks the person possesses.

## Dataset Description and Link:
In order to make their profit, insurance companies must collect a higher premium than
the amount which may become due to the insured person. To achieve this, insurance
companies invest a lot of time, effort, and money in creating models that accurately
predict healthcare expenses.
### Domain : Finance
## Attribute Information:

● age: age of primary beneficiary

● sex: beneficiary’s gender - female or male

● bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are
relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^
2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

● children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of
dependents

● smoker: Smoking or non-smoking

● region: the beneficiary&#39;s residential area in the US; northeast, southeast,
southwest, northwest.

● charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (to be predicted)

● Id: id of beneficiary
